# IEEE SoutheastCon 2026 Hardware Competition

## Overview
The **IEEE SoutheastCon 2026 Hardware Competition** requires teams to build fully autonomous robots to complete a variety of tasks. The robot must meet specific size and weight constraints and operate within a 3-minute time limit.

### Tasks Breakdown
1. **Restore Antenna Power**: Press a button, rotate a crank, enter a keypad sequence, and remove an object.
2. **Signal Communication**: Detect and transmit color signals from antennas to the Death Star.
3. **Object Identification**: Rescue six Astro-jedi-ducks and return them to a specific location.
4. **Autonomous Navigation**: Navigate the environment while completing tasks and avoiding obstacles.

### Scoring Breakdown

| Robot completes a lap around the crater    | 25             | 25             |
| UAV launches successfully                  | 30             | 30             |
| UAV lands successfully                     | 25             | 25             |
| **Maximum Points**                         |                | **258**        |

### Penalties

| Violation                                           | Deduction Per Violation | Maximum Deduction |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Unintentional collision with antennas               | -3                     | -15               |
| Incorrect antenna LED communication to Death Star   | -20                    | -80               |
| **Maximum Deduction**                               |                        | **-95**           |

### Requirements
- The robot must fit within a 12"x12"x12" starting area and weigh no more than 25 lbs.
- Optional: A micro UAV can be used, but it must weigh less than 0.55 lbs.

### Time Limits
- Teams have up to 3 minutes to complete tasks and can end their run early by signaling a judge.
