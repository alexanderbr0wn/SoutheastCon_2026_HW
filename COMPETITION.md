# IEEE SoutheastCon 2026 Hardware Competition

## Overview
The **IEEE SoutheastCon 2026 Hardware Competition** challenges teams to build fully autonomous robots capable of performing a range of tasks on a competition board. The tasks involve navigation, object manipulation, and signal communication. The objective is to complete the tasks within a 3-minute time limit while adhering to strict robot specifications regarding size, weight, and autonomy.

### Tasks Breakdown
1. **Rescue Astro-jedi-ducks**:
   - There are 6 ducks placed throughout the board. One is always located on top of an antenna, and the other 5 are randomly distributed. All ducks must be returned to the Echo Base to score points.
   
2. **Establish Communication with the Death Star**:
   - Teams must establish communication with the Death Star via a photodiode mounted on its surface.

3. **Restore Antenna Power**:
   - Four antennas are scattered across the board. Each antenna has a unique mechanism (e.g., pressing buttons, rotating a crank, or entering a code) to restore its power and activate an LED on top of the antenna.

4. **Signal Communication**:
   - After restoring power, teams must detect the LED color on each antenna and transmit the correct color to the Death Star.

### General Vehicle Requirements
- The robot must fit within a 12"x12"x12" starting area and weigh no more than 25 lbs.
- Teams may use a micro UAV (maximum weight 0.55 lbs) alongside the robot, but both vehicles must begin as a single unit.
- The robot must be fully autonomous, and safety features (like an emergency stop) are highly recommended.
- Teams are encouraged to decorate their robots according to the conference theme.

### Additional Vehicle Specifications
- The robot may extend arms or appendages to perform tasks but must fit within the initial 12"x12"x12" size restriction.
- The robot and any UAV units must not move outside of the netted playing field.
- No explosive, pyrotechnic, toxic, or corrosive materials are allowed.

## Board Design and Zones
The board consists of several distinct zones:
1. **Area #1 (Lower Left)**: Features Antenna #1 and the Lunar Landing Area (where Astro-jedi-ducks must be placed).
2. **Area #2 (Upper Left)**: Contains Antenna #4 and the starting area.
3. **Area #3 (Right Side)**: Largest area, with Antenna #2 and three ducks.
4. **Area #4 (Red Zone)**: Features a crater with Antenna #3 and one duck.

Each area has its own specific tasks and obstacles.

### Antenna Tasks
1. **Antenna #1** (Button Task): Press a button 3 times to restore power.
2. **Antenna #2** (Crank Task): Rotate a crank 360 degrees to restore power.
3. **Antenna #3** (Pressure Plate Task): Remove an Astro-jedi-duck from the plate to restore power.
4. **Antenna #4** (Keypad Task): Enter the code "73738#" on the keypad to restore power.

## Scoring Breakdown

| Robot completes a lap around the crater    | 25             | 25             |
| UAV launches successfully                  | 30             | 30             |
| UAV lands successfully                     | 25             | 25             |
| **Maximum Points**                         |                | **258**        |

### Penalties

| Violation                                           | Deduction Per Violation | Maximum Deduction |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Unintentional collision with antennas               | -3                     | -15               |
| Incorrect antenna LED communication to Death Star   | -20                    | -80               |
| **Maximum Deduction**                               |                        | **-95**           |

### Tiebreakers
In the event of a tie, the team that completes the tasks faster will rank higher. If teams time out, the ranking is based on which team completed the most tasks.

## Time Limits
- Teams have up to 3 minutes to complete the tasks. They may signal the judge when finished if done before the time limit.

## Safety and Compliance
- All robots must comply with safety requirements, and intentional interference with other robots or teams will result in disqualification. 
- Teams should ensure their robots do not leave the game board, and should take precautions to avoid damage to the playing arena.
